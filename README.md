The Kalamata olive is a large, black olive with a smooth, meaty texture named after the city of Kalamata in the southern Peloponnese, Greece. Often used as a table olive, they are usually preserved in wine vinegar or olive oil. Kalamata olives have PDO status in the European Union, meaning that only olives originating from Kalamata can be sold as Kalamata olives.
